# Week 10 Day 2 (**2022-05-10**) :

Today I am working on learning the ins and outs of GitHub. I worked on getting through Microsoft Learning's GitHub beginner course. I've learned the basics of how to edit
in GetHub. This includes updating the code, tracking issues, and confirming pull requests. So far so good! Looking forward to creating my project!
